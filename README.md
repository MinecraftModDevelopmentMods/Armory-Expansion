# Armory-Expansion
The objective is to help integrate other mods with Construct's Armory and Tinker's Construct, supplying tool and armor parts for most materials.

Currently adds stats for armor parts from Construct's Armory for any material registered with Tinker's Construct. Most traits are still missing but will be implemented over time.

- Base Metals;
- Modern Metals;
- PlusTiC;
- Moar Tinkers;
- TAIGA;
- AbyssalCraft Integration;
